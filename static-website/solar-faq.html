That's why solar power is a completely renewable, reliable and clean energy source. It reduces our reliance on dirty sources of power such as oil, coal and natural gas, which produce harmful emissions affecting our health and environment.\n\nSurun pioneered the \"solar-as­-a­-service\" model in 2007. Since then, we have been delivering on a vision to create a planet run by the sun and provide Americans with affordable, reliable and clean energy. Residential solar energy systems represent an investment in the future of the planet, conserving non-renewable energy sources and protecting the environment.\n\nIn addition, solar panels and home batteries are becoming more affordable, accessible, resilient and efficient. They provide peace of mind and energy security for households when the power goes out or the next storm strikes. Unlike those from your utility, Sunrun customers pay predictable, affordable rates for 20 to 25 years. With home solar, you get to control your energy future."}},{"keywords":"Interested in solar, my home and solar, Solar Prep","@type":"Question","name":"Is my home good for solar?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"A lot of things affect how well-suited your home is for solar, including where your home is, the angle of your roof, how much shade it gets throughout the day, and how old your home is.\n\nOur solar advisors can help you determine if your home is a good fit for solar at the moment. They’ll run a custom analysis of your home with our proprietary solar design technology, BrightPath,™ and they’ll get a sense for your energy needs."}},{"keywords":"Interested in solar, my home and solar, Solar Prep","@type":"Question","name":"How many solar panels will my home need?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Every household is different. When determining the number of solar panels your home needs, consider the following questions:\n\nHow much power do I need? Check your electric bills to see how many kilowatt hours (kWhs) you use throughout the year. We’ll go over this with you in detail during your free solar consultation to figure out just how much power your panels will need to produce.\n\nWhat’s your climate like? The number of panels you need depends on how much sun reaches the ground where you are.\n\nHow much direct sun hits your roof? Shading, which direction your roof faces, and any aesthetic preferences you have can impact how big your system needs to be.\n\nAt Sunrun, we have proprietary solar design technology called BrightPath™ to help us create a customized system that maximizes energy production better and faster than if we did it by hand."}},{"keywords":"Interested in solar, my home and solar, Solar Prep","@type":"Question","name":"Why do you need my historical electricity usage?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Your historical electricity usage allows us to design a custom solar system that is the right size for your home.\n\nElectricity usage varies from person to person and from season to season. That’s why we request a full year of your electricity bills so we can build a system that’s right for you.\n\nYour sales consultant is trained to review a year’s worth of usage data so we can get the full picture. Energy usage can change with the seasons so we look at 12-months of data to best understand your home’s usage patterns and needs."}},{"keywords":"Interested in solar, my home and solar, Solar Prep","@type":"Question","name":"How do you customize my solar system?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"We customize your home solar system by taking into account your past usage, the available roof space and your design preferences to make sure the system will work for you and your home.\n\nWe start with your historical usage and design a solar system that will provide you with the right amount of power based on how much you normally use.\n\nThen we look at your roof via satellite imagery to see how many panels can fit on each roof plane, keeping in mind that south-facing roofs are the best for solar.\n\nWe verify our measurements and system design with a site survey,a visit to your home to check the roof and your main electrical panel."}},{"keywords":"Interested in solar, my home and solar, Solar Prep","@type":"Question","name":"Will I notice anything different after I go solar?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"After you switch to solar, you won’t notice a difference. Your lights, appliances, televisions and everything else that uses electricity will work exactly as they did before.\n\nThe one key difference you will notice after switching to solar is in how you pay for your power. You will still receive a monthly bill from your utility company. If you have a monthly bill with Sunrun, you will have two separate bills.\n\nHow much energy you end up having to buy from your utility depends on the size of your solar system and how much electricity you're actually using.\n\nBecause of weather and seasonal changes, your utility bill will vary from month to month. But you’ll always know exactly what you owe Sunrun for the duration of our agreement."}},{"keywords":"Interested in solar, my home and solar, Solar Prep","@type":"Question","name":"Does my state offer incentives to go solar?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"See where Sunrun currently operates and what solar incentives may be available in your state. The most common solar incentives include state tax credits, net metering and rebates from your local utility. No matter what state you live in, you’ll also be eligible for the federal solar tax credit when you purchase your own solar system.\n\nThe great thing about BrightSave Monthly is that any benefits you would get through rebates and tax credits come to you in the form of a lower monthly cost with Sunrun.

Solar panels\nSolar panels are made of photovoltaic cells that convert sunlight to direct current electricity (DC electricity). As long as the sun ray’s are making contact with your roof, your panels are converting solar radiation into DC electricity. Even when it’s cloudy, you can still expect your panels to produce 10% to 25% of their normal output. But your electricity isn’t ready just yet. You’ll need an inverter to get the kind of power you need to turn the lights on.\n\n2. Inverter\nThe inverter takes the DC electricity produced by your solar panels and turns it into alternating current electricity (AC electricity). It’s typically installed on an exterior wall of your house, or in the garage.\n\n3. Main electric service panel\nSolar electricity from your inverter flows to the electrical panel, and then into to your home where it powers your lights and appliances. If your panels generate more solar energy than you use, the excess power will flow to the utility grid. Even better? You might even earn energy credits from your local utility for the power you send.\n\n4. Sunrun meter\nYour Sunrun meter monitors your system production and sends the information to us through a wireless signal. Since it tracks your energy production 24/7, it will automatically alert Sunrun if it detects problems or irregularities. That way, we can make sure your solar system is in the very best shape without you ever having to lift a finger.\n\n5. Utility meter\nWhen your system produces more than you need, the excess energy is sold back to your utility and credited to your monthly electric bill. When you need more energy than your solar system can produce, your home will automatically pull the energy from your utility. Your utility meter measures how much energy comes from and goes to the grid."}},{"keywords":"Interested in solar, my solar options, Home Solar","@type":"Question","name":"What is installed as a part of a solar system?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Each home is different, and the equipment we install can vary from house to house.

In general, here’s what you can expect.\n\n1) Solar panels\nSolar panels convert sunlight into direct current electricity (DC).\n\n2) Inverter\nYour inverter tells energy where to flow and converts it into alternating current electricity (AC), so it can be used in your home.\n\n3) Battery\nYour battery stores extra solar energy for later use, like during a power outage.\n\n4) Sunrun meter\nSolar production is measured and monitored by your Sunrun meter so we can make sure your system is producing as much energy as possible.\n\n5) Main electrical panel\nYour electrical panel, or more familiarly the \"fuse box,\" distributes AC electricity to your entire home.\n\n6) Backup panel\nYour backup panel connects your battery to the breakers you chose to backup during installation.\n\n7) Utility meter\nWhen the sun is shining, you may get all of your energy from solar. But due to things like weather, winter, and nighttime, you will still have to buy some energy the old-fashioned way.

However, you do still have power at night when you go solar through net metering or a home battery.\n\nNet Metering Makes the Most of Your Solar Production\nConnecting your solar installation to the grid enables net metering. When your solar panels produce excess energy, it's sent to the grid. The utility company then provides credit on your account. At night, you can apply those credits toward drawing electricity from the grid so your solar power never goes to waste. Net metering exists in some form in all of the markets that Sunrun operates in except for Hawaii.\n\nSolar Battery Storage Offers Energy Independence\nSince there is no Net Energy Metering available for new customers in Hawaii, we use battery storage to make use of solar power at night. Solar batteries maximize your panels’ daytime energy production and provide electricity for later use. So instead of sending your excess electricity to the grid, store it and use your own energy. You'll consume electricity from the battery first before drawing from the grid.\n\nA home battery or net metering enable your solar installation to access free or reduced-cost electricity at night.

Solar panels\nSolar panels are made of photovoltaic cells that convert sunlight to direct current electricity (DC electricity). As long as the sun ray’s are making contact with your roof, your panels are converting solar radiation into DC electricity. Even when it’s cloudy, you can still expect your panels to produce 10% to 25% of their normal output. But your electricity isn’t ready just yet. You’ll need an inverter to get the kind of power you need to turn the lights on.\n\n2. Inverter\nThe inverter takes the DC electricity produced by your solar panels and turns it into alternating current electricity (AC electricity). It’s typically installed on an exterior wall of your house, or in the garage.\n\n3. Main electric service panel\nSolar electricity from your inverter flows to the electrical panel, and then into to your home where it powers your lights and appliances. If your panels generate more solar energy than you use, the excess power will flow to the utility grid. Even better? You might even earn energy credits from your local utility for the power you send.\n\n4. Sunrun meter\nYour Sunrun meter monitors your system production and sends the information to us through a wireless signal. Since it tracks your energy production 24/7, it will automatically alert Sunrun if it detects problems or irregularities. That way, we can make sure your solar system is in the very best shape without you ever having to lift a finger.\n\n5. Utility meter\nWhen your system produces more than you need, the excess energy is sold back to your utility and credited to your monthly electric bill. When you need more energy than your solar system can produce, your home will automatically pull the energy from your utility. Your utility meter measures how much energy comes from and goes to the grid."}},{"keywords":"Already have solar, My Solar System, Getting Started","@type":"Question","name":"When will I be able to turn my system on?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"You can turn on your solar system when we are granted permission to operate (PTO) from your utility.

For months where your solar panels cover less than 100% of your home’s electricity usage, you will purchase the remaining electricity from your utility. Your utility will track how much power your home took from the grid and compare that to how much power your solar panels sent back to the grid, and it will charge you for the difference. This is known as net metering."}},{"keywords":"Already have solar, My Bills, Utility Billing","@type":"Question","name":"How is my utility bill different now that I've gone solar?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"When the sun is shining, you may get all of your energy from solar, but due to things like weather, winter and nighttime, you will still have to buy some energy from the utility. As a result, you will still receive a utility bill, but it will be a little different from before.\n\nYour utility bill will now include energy that you sent back into the grid, as well as a billing credit as compensation. This credit will be debited from your total. If the credit is larger than what you owe for the energy you purchased, it will carry over to next month’s bill.\n\nRemember, this billing credit is only for the excess energy you sold back into the grid. It does not represent your full solar production. Most of the energy you produce is used right away.

If your utility bills have gone up, think about any lifestyle changes that may have impacted your home’s usage: a new addition to your household, new appliances, lowering the AC, etc. You can check to see if your home is using more electricity by looking at how many kWhs you received from your utility and comparing it to how many combined kWhs you received from Sunrun (this is equivalent to how many kWhs your panels produced, as shown on your mySunrun dashboard) plus the kWhs you received from your utility company (look for your “net usage” on your utility bill).\n\nSeasonality - no matter where you live, your solar panels will produce more electricity in the summer and less in the winter because days are shorter in the winter and the sun is lower on the horizon.

It will automatically turn back on when there’s enough sun to produce electricity. If you see a red light when the sun is shining, there may be an issue.).\nOrange: The AC disconnect or breaker switch is off.\n\nError Codes\n\nThe inverter will also have a screen which may show an error message if the equipment is not working correctly. These are some of the most common error codes:\n\nFac-Bfr: Ground Fault\nState 207\nTry the troubleshooting steps below if you happen to see one of these codes:\n\n1) Locate and reset your breaker switch\n\nThis small switch should be in your main service panel with the rest of the breaker switches to your home, usually located at the very bottom or top of the panel. It should be labeled solar, photovoltaic, PV or Sunrun.\nMake sure this switch is in the on position.\n\n2) Reset the AC disconnect\n\nGenerally this small box is located right near your inverter, the bigger box.\nThe AC disconnect is a smaller 1’ x 1.5’ box with a large, lever switch on the right side.\nTo turn this switch on, flip the switch into the upward position.\n\n3) Reset the inverter*\n\nThe inverter is normally on the side of your home or in your garage.\nIt’s the large 1.5’ x 3’ box with a circular dial switch on the bottom.\nIf you cannot see the switch, it may be behind a door on the bottom third of the inverter.\nTo turn this switch on, turn it a quarter turn clockwise until it is facing upward.\n\n*Some Sunrun systems have microinverters on each panel. These systems do not have a large inverter or a switch to turn.\n\n4) Check the inverter for continuing errors.\nCheck the screen to see whether error codes return.\nCheck the light on the face of the inverter to see whether it turns green, yellow or red.\nIf the inverter error persists or a yellow or red light comes back, please make a note of any error codes and contact Customer care."}}]}</script><meta http-equiv="origin-trial" content="A41wt2Lsq30A9Ox/WehogvJckPI4aY9RoSxhb8FMtVnqaUle1AtI6Yf7Wk+7+Wm0AfDDOkMX+Wn6wnDpBWYgWwYAAAB8eyJvcmlnaW4iOiJodHRwczovL2Fkcm9sbC5jb206NDQzIiwiZmVhdHVyZSI6IkludGVyZXN0Q29ob3J0QVBJIiwiZXhwaXJ5IjoxNjI2MjIwNzk5LCJpc1N1YmRvbWFpbiI6dHJ1ZSwiaXNUaGlyZFBhcnR5Ijp0cnVlfQ=="><script id="adroll_scr_exp" onerror="window.adroll_exp_list = [];" type="text/javascript" src="https://s.adroll.com/j/exp/2RUD72REE5DPLFICZQM72E/index.js"></script><script type="text/javascript" src="https://s.adroll.com/j/pre/2RUD72REE5DPLFICZQM72E/MU3IXS6FKRBS7IJXK4UQWS/fpconsent.js"></script><script type="text/javascript" src="https://s.adroll.com/j/pre/2RUD72REE5DPLFICZQM72E/MU3IXS6FKRBS7IJXK4UQWS/index.js"></script><script type="text/javascript" src="https://d.adroll.com/consent/check/2RUD72REE5DPLFICZQM72E?adroll_fpc=0e24a76c4b0e4ddfaa8e022c875a9807-1675179645475&amp;pv=78966038330.94551&amp;arrfrr=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sunrun.com%2Fgo-solar-center%2Fsolar-faq&amp;_s=140bc10510d15c8d112297d073494fa2&amp;_b=2"></script><script async="true" type="text/javascript" src="https://d.adroll.com/pixel/2RUD72REE5DPLFICZQM72E/MU3IXS6FKRBS7IJXK4UQWS?adroll_fpc=0e24a76c4b0e4ddfaa8e022c875a9807-1675179645475&amp;pv=78966038330.94551&amp;arrfrr=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sunrun.com%2Fgo-solar-center%2Fsolar-faq&amp;cookie=I6DJLU3MF5GUPDGLLPELFQ%3A1%7CMU3IXS6FKRBS7IJXK4UQWS%3A1%7C2RUD72REE5DPLFICZQM72E%3A2&amp;adroll_s_ref=https%3A//www.sunrun.com/&amp;keyw="></script></head><body class="html not-front not-logged-in no-sidebars page-node page-node- page-node-11731 node-type-page go-solar-center solar-faq closed-for-calls sunrun-tracking-processed has-promo-banner" style=""><div style="width: 1px; height: 1px; display: inline; position: absolute;"></div><script src="js/pageid.js" async="" type="text/javascript"></script><script async="true" type="text/javascript" src="https://d.adroll.com/pixel/2RUD72REE5DPLFICZQM72E/MU3IXS6FKRBS7IJXK4UQWS?adroll_fpc=0e24a76c4b0e4ddfaa8e022c875a9807-1675179645475&amp;pv=78966038330.94551&amp;arrfrr=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sunrun.com%2Fgo-solar-center%2Fsolar-faq&amp;cookie=MU3IXS6FKRBS7IJXK4UQWS%3A7%7C2RUD72REE5DPLFICZQM72E%3A11%7CI6DJLU3MF5GUPDGLLPELFQ%3A10&amp;adroll_s_ref=https%3A//www.sunrun.com/&amp;keyw="></script><script src="https://create.lidstatic.com/campaign/6ee76ac5-5365-872c-99c4-7a45603b6ef8.js?snippet_version=2" async="" id="LeadiDscript_campaign" type="text/javascript"></script><div style="width: 1px; height: 1px; display: inline; position: absolute;"></div>

		<div class="collapse f5 lh-copy pl4" id="why-should-i-switch">
			<p>The sun rises every day. That's why solar power is a completely renewable, reliable and clean energy source. It reduces our reliance on dirty sources of power such as oil, coal and natural gas, which produce harmful emissions affecting our health and environment.</p>

			<p>Sunrun pioneered the "solar-as­-a­-service" model in 2007. Since then, we have been delivering on a vision to create a planet run by the sun and provide Americans with affordable, reliable and clean energy. Residential solar energy systems represent an investment in the future of the planet, conserving non-renewable energy sources and protecting the environment.</p>

			<p>In addition, solar panels and home batteries are becoming more affordable, accessible, resilient and efficient. They provide peace of mind and energy security for households when the power goes out or the next storm strikes. Unlike those from your utility, Sunrun customers pay predictable, affordable rates for 20 to 25 years. With home solar, you get to control your energy future.</p>

		<div class="collapse f5 lh-copy pl4" id="how-many-solar-panels-will-my-home-need">
			<p>Every household is different. When determining the number of solar panels your home needs, consider the following questions:</p>

			<p>How much power do I need? Check your electric bills to see how many kilowatt hours (kWhs) you use throughout the year. We’ll go over this with you in detail during your free solar consultation to figure out just how much power your panels will need to produce.</p>

			<p>What’s your climate like? The number of panels you need depends on how much sun reaches the ground where you are.</p>

			<p>How much direct sun hits your roof? Shading, which direction your roof faces, and any aesthetic preferences you have can impact how big your system needs to be.</p>

			<p>At Sunrun, we have proprietary solar design technology called BrightPath™ to help us create a customized system that maximizes energy production better and faster than if we did it by hand.</p>

		<div class="collapse f5 lh-copy pl4" id="why-do-you-need-my-historical-electricity-usage">
			<p>Your historical electricity usage allows us to design a custom solar system that is the right size for your home.</p>

			<p>Electricity usage varies from person to person and from season to season. That’s why we request a full year of your electricity bills so we can build a system that’s right for you.</p>

			<p>Your sales consultant is trained to review a year’s worth of usage data so we can get the full picture. Energy usage can change with the seasons so we look at 12-months of data to best understand your home’s usage patterns and needs.</p>

		<div class="collapse f5 lh-copy pl4" id="how-do-you-customize-my-solar-system">
			<p>We customize your home solar system by taking into account your past usage, the available roof space and your design preferences to make sure the system will work for you and your home.</p>

			<p>We start with your historical usage and design a solar system that will provide you with the right amount of power based on how much you normally use.</p>

			<p>Then we look at your roof via satellite imagery to see how many panels can fit on each roof plane, keeping in mind that south-facing roofs are the best for solar.</p>

			<p>We verify our measurements and system design with a site survey,a visit to your home to check the roof and your main electrical panel.</p>

			<p>Finally, we reconfirm our final design with you so you know exactly what it will look like and how much electricity you'll receive from solar.</p>

		<div class="collapse f5 lh-copy pl4" id="will-i-notice-anything-different-after-i-go-solar">
			<p>After you switch to solar, you won’t notice a difference. Your lights, appliances, televisions and everything else that uses electricity will work exactly as they did before.<br>
				<br>
				The one key difference you will notice after switching to solar is in how you pay for your power. You will still receive a monthly bill from your utility company. If you have a monthly bill with Sunrun, you will have two separate bills.<br>
				<br>
				How much energy you end up having to buy from your utility depends on the size of your solar system and how much electricity you're actually using.<br>

		<!-- Answer -->

		<div class="collapse f5 lh-copy pl4" id="how-does-a-home-solar-system-work">
			<p>A home solar system is made up of components that all work together to convert the power of sunlight into usable energy for your lights, appliances and devices.</p>

			<p>1. Solar panels<br>
				Solar panels are made of photovoltaic cells that convert sunlight to direct current electricity (DC electricity). As long as the sun ray’s are making contact with your roof, your panels are converting solar radiation into DC electricity. Even when it’s cloudy, you can still expect your panels to produce 10% to 25% of their normal output. But your electricity isn’t ready just yet. You’ll need an inverter to get the kind of power you need to turn the lights on.</p>

			<p>2. Inverter<br>
				The inverter takes the DC electricity produced by your solar panels and turns it into alternating current electricity (AC electricity). It’s typically installed on an exterior wall of your house, or in the garage.</p>

			<p>3. Main electric service panel<br>
				Solar electricity from your inverter flows to the electrical panel, and then into to your home where it powers your lights and appliances. If your panels generate more solar energy than you use, the excess power will flow to the utility grid. Even better? You might even earn energy credits from your local utility for the power you send.</p>

			<p>4. Sunrun meter<br>
				Your Sunrun meter monitors your system production and sends the information to us through a wireless signal. Since it tracks your energy production 24/7, it will automatically alert Sunrun if it detects problems or irregularities. That way, we can make sure your solar system is in the very best shape without you ever having to lift a finger.</p>

			<p>5. Utility meter<br>
				When your system produces more than you need, the excess energy is sold back to your utility and credited to your monthly electric bill. When you need more energy than your solar system can produce, your home will automatically pull the energy from your utility. Your utility meter measures how much energy comes from and goes to the grid.</p>

		<!-- Answer -->

		<div class="collapse f5 lh-copy pl4" id="what-is-installed-as-a-part-of-a-brightbox-systemb">
			<p>Each home is different, and the equipment we install can vary from house to house. In general, here’s what you can expect.</p>

			<p>1) Solar panels<br>
				Solar panels convert sunlight into direct current electricity (DC).</p>

			<p>2) Inverter<br>
				Your inverter tells energy where to flow and converts it into alternating current electricity (AC), so it can be used in your home.</p>

			<p>3) Battery<br>
				Your battery stores extra solar energy for later use, like during a power outage.</p>

			<p>4) Sunrun meter<br>
				Solar production is measured and monitored by your Sunrun meter so we can make sure your system is producing as much energy as possible.</p>

			<p>5) Main electrical panel<br>
				Your electrical panel, or more familiarly the "fuse box," distributes AC electricity to your entire home.</p>

			<p>6) Backup panel<br>
				Your backup panel connects your battery to the breakers you chose to backup during installation.</p>

			<p>7) Utility meter<br>
				When the sun is shining, you may get all of your energy from solar. But due to things like weather, winter, and nighttime, you will still have to buy some energy the old-fashioned way. Your utility meter measures how much energy comes from and goes to the grid.</p>

		<!-- Answer -->

		<div class="collapse f5 lh-copy pl4" id="how-does-brightbox-work-during-a-power-outage">
			<p>Sunrun’s batteries can back up four breakers. During installation, we will help you decide what to back up. Many customers choose to back up their refrigerator, lights, wifi and a garage door.</p>

			<p>If there is a power outage, your battery will take over sending power to your backed-up breakers within a few seconds and will continue to do so until power is restored or the battery runs out of energy. How long the battery lasts will depend on how much energy you use.</p>

			<p>Your system is designed to supply approximately 8 to 12 hours of backup energy, plus whatever the sun provides during the day. But that can vary based a variety of factors:</p>

			<p>Whether the outage happens during the day or at night<br>
				What season it is<br>
				What you’re backing up<br>
				How much energy you use</p>

			<p>The battery will recharge when the sun comes up, so you will be able to power through multi-day outages should they ever occur.</p>

			<p>Remember, you can always check the charge of your battery to help you plan your usage and make sure you have power through the night.</p>

			<p>If you live in Hawaii, your backup solution may be slightly different. A quad outlet installed near your inverter will allow you to plug in up to four things during an outage if we are unable to back up your breakers directly.</p>

		<div class="collapse f5 lh-copy pl4" id="what-is-time-of-use-az">
			<p>Think of it as energy surge pricing. Time-of-use (TOU) rates are electricity rates in which utilities charge for both how much and when you use energy. Under these rates, energy tends to cost more during peak demand times, such as late afternoon and evening when demand is highest.</p>

			<p>Brightbox helps manage TOU rates by optimizing your battery’s charge and discharge behavior to offset power when it is most expensive.</p>

		<!-- Answer -->

		<div class="collapse f5 lh-copy pl4" id="does-california-offer-any-incentives-for-home-solar-and-batteries">
			<p>There are many reasons to go solar with battery storage in California, including a great incentive available to households that purchase home batteries. The Self-Generation Incentive Program (SGIP) incentivizes PG&amp;E, SCE, SCG or SDG&amp;E-powered households when they install a home solar battery to help defray costs for installing batteries. The incentive value will decrease as more households apply for it, so take advantage of it as soon as you can.</p>

			<p>Other California incentives include rebates from your local utility and the federal solar tax credit, a dollar-for-dollar reduction against your federal income tax. The 30% tax credit applies as long as the home solar system is installed by December 31, 2019. Starting in 2020, the value of the tax credit will step down to 26%, and then again to 22% in 2021. After 2021, the tax credit for residential solar ends. Get more information on California solar incentives. {Link to /solar-by-state/ca/california-solar-tax-credit]</p>

			<p>For customers with solar leases, Sunrun applies for these rebates and tax credits, and automatically includes the benefits in our pricing.</p>

		<!-- Answer -->

		<div class="collapse f5 lh-copy pl4" id="what-is-time-of-use-ca">
			<p>Think of it as energy surge pricing. Time-of-use (TOU) rates are electricity rates in which utilities charge for both how much and when you use energy. Under these rates, energy tends to cost more during peak demand times, such as late afternoon and evening when demand is highest.</p>

			<p>Brightbox helps manage TOU rates by optimizing your battery’s charge and discharge behavior to offset power when it is most expensive.</p>

    <!-- Answer -->
    <div class="faq__answer collapse" id="how-does-brightbox-work-in-florida">
      <p>WITH BRIGHTBOX YOU ARE STILL ON THE GRID<br>
	Sunrun does not offer “off the grid” systems. Even with a battery, you will still be connected to your utility. This ensures you still have power if your panels or battery ever stop working.</p>

<p>SUNRUN HAS OPTIMIZED YOUR BATTERY SETTINGS TO MAXIMIZE YOUR BENEFITS<br>
	You will not be able to control when you are charging or discharging the battery yourself. Sunrun has designed and programmed your system to optimize your utility rate offset, environmental impact and back-up benefit. Manually changing when your battery charges and discharges would only end up costing you money.</p>

<p>YOUR BATTERY WILL KICK IN AUTOMATICALLY DURING A POWER OUTAGE<br>
	Sunrun’s batteries can back up four breakers. During installation, we will help you decide what to back up. Many customers choose to back up their refrigerator, lights, wifi and a garage door.</p>

<p>If there is a power outage, your battery will take over sending power to your backed up breakers within a few seconds and will continue to do so until power is restored or the battery runs out of energy. How long the battery last will depend on how much energy you use.</p>

<p>Your system is designed to supply approximately 8 to 12 hours of backup energy, plus whatever the sun provides during the day. But that can vary based a variety of factors:</p>

<p>Whether the outage happens during the day or at night<br>
	What season it is<br>
	What you’re backing up<br>
	How much energy you use</p>

<p>The battery will recharge when the sun comes up, so you will be able to power through multi-day outages should they ever occur.</p>

<p>BRIGHTBOX PROTECTS YOU FROM PEAK UTILITY RATES<br>
	Brightbox will power your home during peak rate times, and sell any extra energy back to the grid when rates are highest.</p>

<p>If you aren't already on TOU rates, you can ask your utility to update your account.</p>

<p>From there, it’s all automatic. We’ll program your battery to pay attention to how much your utility is charging for energy and take over when prices spike.</p>

<p><br>
	WE WILL ALWAYS SAVE SOME POWER IN THE BATTERY IN CASE OF A POWER OUTAGE<br>
	No matter how profitable it is to send energy into the grid, we always reserve 20% of your battery’s capacity for its primary function: keeping the lights on during a power outage.</p>

    <!-- Answer -->
    <div class="faq__answer collapse" id="does-florida-offer-any-incentives-for-home-batteries">
      <p>Florida solar incentives like its Property Tax Exemption offers tax benefits at an average of $15,000. Another major incentive is the federal solar tax credit, which gives you a dollar-for-dollar reduction against your federal income tax. The 30% tax credit applies as long as the home solar system is installed by December 31, 2019. Starting in 2020, the value of the tax credit will step down to 26%, and then again to 22% in 2021. After 2021, the tax credit for residential solar ends. Get more information on Florida solar incentives.</p>

<p>For customers with solar leases, Sunrun applies for these rebates and tax credits, and automatically includes the benefits in our pricing.</p>

      <p>WITH BRIGHTBOX YOU ARE STILL ON THE GRID<br>
	Sunrun does not offer “off the grid” systems. Even with a battery, you will still be connected to your utility. This ensures you still have power if your panels or battery ever stop working.</p>

<p>SUNRUN HAS OPTIMIZED YOUR BATTERY SETTINGS TO MAXIMIZE YOUR BENEFITS<br>
	You will not be able to control when you are charging or discharging the battery yourself.&nbsp; Sunrun has designed and programmed your system to maximize your environmental impact and back-up benefit. Manually changing when your battery charges and discharges would only end up costing you money.</p>

<p>YOUR BATTERY WILL KICK IN AUTOMATICALLY DURING A POWER OUTAGE<br>
	Sunrun’s batteries can back up four breakers. During installation, we will help you decide what to back up. Many customers choose to back up their refrigerator, lights, wifi and a garage door.</p>

<p>If there is a power outage, your battery will take over sending power to your backed up breakers within a few seconds and will continue to do so until power is restored or the battery runs out of energy. How long the battery last will depend on how much energy you use.</p>

<p>Your system is designed to supply approximately 8 to 12 hours of backup energy, plus whatever the sun provides during the day. But that can vary based a variety of factors:</p>

<p>Whether the outage happens during the day or at night<br>
	What season it is<br>
	What you’re backing up<br>
	How much energy you use</p>

    <!-- Answer -->
    <div class="faq__answer collapse" id="does-new-york-offer-any-incentives-for-home-batteries">
      <p>One of the best reasons to own a solar system in New York is its Megawatt Block Solar Incentive, where you’ll receive a rebate on your system based on where you live, your utility, and the size of your system. The best part? State-approved solar installers will automatically apply the rebate to your bill so you don’t have to lift a finger. Plus, there's the New York’s generous Solar Energy System Equipment Credit, which covers 25% or up to $5,000 of your system cost. Finally, you can take advantage of the federal solar tax credit, which gives you a dollar-for-dollar reduction against your federal income tax. The 30% tax credit applies as long as the home solar system is installed by December 31, 2019. Starting in 2020, the value of the tax credit will step down to 26%, and then again to 22% in 2021. After 2021, the tax credit for residential solar ends.</p>

      Is it better to lease or buy solar panels?    </h5>
    <!-- Answer -->
    <div class="faq__answer collapse" id="is-it-better-to-lease-or-buy">
      <p>Leasing and buying solar panels come with their own unique advantages.</p>

<p>Purchasing solar generally requires upfront investment which can make it cost-prohibitive for many. That’s why Sunrun offers stress-free solar leasing so you can switch to solar for as little as $0 down. When you lease solar panels or pay for power through a Power Purchase Agreement (PPA), you are only responsible for a locked-in monthly payment. Since Sunrun owns the system when it is leased, we’ll also provide top-notch monitoring and maintenance during the length of your agreement, free of charge. That means clean, worry-free energy. And if it breaks, we’ll fix it.</p>

<p>We also know that many people want to own their equipment which is why Sunrun also gives you the option to buy your solar panels. When you own your solar system, you own your production and all the benefits that come with solar investment. That means solar incentives like state solar rebates, net metering and the federal solar tax credit will go directly to you. However, you’ll be responsible for any repairs and maintenance your solar system needs outside the scope of your solar system’s warranty.</p>

      What's a solar lease or PPA?    </h5>
    <!-- Answer -->
    <div class="faq__answer collapse" id="whats-a-solar-lease-or-ppa">
      <p>Knowing there had to be a more affordable way to bring clean energy to the people, we invented solar leasing and power purchase agreements, or PPAs. So instead of purchasing a system outright, we offer additional options that require little to zero upfront costs.</p>

<p>The difference between a solar lease and solar PPA is simple: With a lease, you pay a fixed monthly “rent” in return for use of the system. With a PPA you pay a fixed price per kWh for power generated. We’ll help you decide which option is best for you. So now that you know what a solar lease and PPA is, you’re probably wondering why you shouldn’t just buy a home solar system outright. Here are a few reasons why:</p>

<p>Get started for as little as $0 down.<br>

      <p>With a solar power purchase agreement, or PPA, you pay for the power, not the panels. The amount you pay is based on a per kilowatt-hour rate for the electricity produced by your solar panels, and is usually lower than what the local utility charges for electricity.</p>

<p>With <a href="full-amount-solar-lease.html">BrightSave Prepaid</a>, you can go solar with just one, up front payment that covers 25 years worth of solar power. When you choose <a href="full-amount-solar-lease.html">BrightSave Prepaid</a>, we’ll also actively monitor and maintain your solar panels over the life of your agreement, so all you have to do is enjoy that glorious solar energy made right on your roof.</p>

      Is it better to lease or buy solar panels?    </h5>
    <!-- Answer -->
    <div class="faq__answer collapse" id="is-it-better-to-lease-or-buy-solar-panels-solar-purchase">
      <p>Leasing and buying solar panels come with their own unique advantages.</p>

<p>Purchasing solar generally requires upfront investment which can make it cost-prohibitive for many. That’s why Sunrun offers stress-free solar leasing so you can go solar for as little as $0 down. When you lease solar panels or pay for power through a <a href="purchase-solar-system.html">Power Purchase Agreement (PPA)</a> you are only responsible for a locked-in monthly payment. Since Sunrun owns the system when it is leased, we’ll also provide top-notch monitoring and maintenance during the length of your agreement, free of charge. That means clean, worry-free energy. And if it breaks, we’ll fix it.</p>

<p>We also know that many people want to own their equipment which is why Sunrun also gives you the option to buy your solar panels. When you own your solar system, you own your production and all the benefits that come with solar investment.That means solar incentives like state solar rebates, net metering and the federal solar tax credit will go directly to you. However, you’ll be responsible for any repairs and maintenance your solar system needs outside the scope of your solar system’s warranty.</p>

      <p>Studies have shown that owning home solar panels can significantly increase your property value.* Solar homes in California sell for $20,000 more on average, while solar homes in other states sell for about $15,000 more. With numbers like that, you can likely recoup the cost of your solar system when you sell your home. Not only will you enjoy clean, reliable energy, you’ll know you've made a smart investment.</p>

    <!-- Answer -->
    <div class="faq__answer collapse" id="how-does-a-solar-system-purchase-work">
      <p>When you purchase a home solar system from Sunrun, you purchase the equipment and Sunrun takes care of everything related to the installation. When you buy your own system, you will directly receive the applicable federal and state solar incentives, tax credits and rebates.</p>

<p>Sunrun offers two different ways to finance your solar purchase: BrightBuy and BrightAdvantage.</p>

<p>BrightBuy is the full upfront purchase option where you would pay for the full price of the system at installation.</p>

<p>BrightAdvantage allows you to finance your solar system purchase with low, fixed monthly payments, upon qualification, at a competitive interest for as little as $0 down.</p>

<p>With either solar purchase option, you also have the option to add Protection Plus which is our service package that includes system monitoring and maintenance for the lifetime of the agreement.</p>

      <p>The interest on loans for solar panels are only tax deductible if they are secured loans, such as a home equity loan. BrightAdvantage is an unsecured loan through one of our trusted loan partners, so the interest on your loan will not be eligible for a tax deduction. However, you’ll be able to purchase a solar system for little to $0 down with the added benefit of low, fixed interest rates. You’ll also still be able to take advantage of incentives like the federal solar tax credit. To learn more, contact one of our solar advisors to see if you qualify.</p>

<p>When we design our systems and estimate their production, we take in to account the amount of sunlight that your specific region receives each year. This means that your system will be sized appropriately for the amount of sunny (or cloudy) days you receive each year.</p>

      Do solar panels work at night?    </h5>
    <!-- Answer -->
    <div class="faq__answer collapse" id="do-solar-panels-work-at-night">
      <p>Solar panels need sunlight to create electricity--they’re dormant at night. However, you do still have power at night when you go solar through net metering or a home battery.</p>

<p>Net Metering Makes the Most of Your Solar Production<br>
	Connecting your solar installation to the grid enables net metering. When your solar panels produce excess energy, it's sent to the grid. The utility company then provides credit on your account. At night, you can apply those credits toward drawing electricity from the grid so your solar power never goes to waste. Net metering exists in some form in all of the markets that Sunrun operates in except for Hawaii.</p>

<p>Solar Battery Storage Offers Energy Independence<br>
	Since there is no Net Energy Metering available for new customers in Hawaii, we use battery storage to make use of solar power at night. Solar batteries maximize your panels’ daytime energy production and provide electricity for later use. So instead of sending your excess electricity to the grid, store it and use your own energy. You'll consume electricity from the battery first before drawing from the grid.</p>

<p>A home battery or net metering enable your solar installation to access free or reduced-cost electricity at night. That’s how solar is a 24/7 affordable energy option. Sunrun solar panels and a Brightbox battery will have you covered both day and night.</p>

      <p>During a power outage, Sunrun solar systems automatically turn off to protect utility workers that may be working on power lines.

    <div class="faq__answer collapse" id="will-treesshade-impact-my-solar-performance">
      <p>Shade on your solar panels decreases their efficiency. When we design your system we account for existing shade on your roof but changes in tree shape or height can increase shade and lead to decreased production over time. When you go solar, it is best to keep your trees trimmed so they do not block the sun from shining on your panels.</p>

      Will my solar system still work well after 25 years?    </h5>
    <!-- Answer -->
    <div class="faq__answer collapse" id="will-my-solar-system-still-work-well-after-25-years">
      <p>The solar panels on your roof should continue to produce electricity well past the 25 year mark but their efficiency will decrease slightly over time at an average rate of 0.5% per year.</p>

<p>We design our solar agreements with the lifespan of our equipment in mind and have taken this expected decline in performance into account in our production estimates.</p>

<p>This means that after 25 years, your system should still be operating at around 88% of its original capacity and providing your home with clean, renewable energy.</p>

      What if my solar panels don't produce enough power?    </h5>
    <!-- Answer -->
    <div class="faq__answer collapse" id="what-if-my-solar-panels-dont-produce-enough-power">
      <p>When your panels don't produce as much energy as you need you will then purchase any additional power from the grid.&nbsp; This is not a sign that something is wrong, rather it is a very normal part of the seasonal shifts in solar energy production and your own personal energy consumption.</p>

<p>When we’re designing your home solar system, we make sure it fits your household electricity needs, helping control your energy costs over time. We look at 12 months of past electricity usage to make sure your solar panels produce the the right amount of power for your home over the course of a full year.</p>

<p>Keep in mind that there’s the chance you’ll have an unseasonably hot summer that requires you to run the air conditioning more than usual. If that’s the case, you may have to use some extra electricity from your local utility, resulting in a slightly higher energy bill for that month. Your solar panels would still be producing the amount of power they’re supposed to—your higher-than-average energy usage will just need an added boost from the grid to support it.</p>

      <p>When you go solar, the way that you pay for your power also changes.</p>

<p>Whether you choose to purchase your solar system or pay monthly, you will still receive a utility bill as you will now receive power from two sources, your solar system and the gird.</p>

<p>The payment you make to Sunrun, whether upfront or on a monthly basis is for your solar. Your utility bill will then be for any extra power that you need that month that the solar system does not produce. How much energy you end up having to buy from your utility depends on the size of your solar system and how much energy you're actually using. With weather and seasonal changes, your utility bill will vary. For this reason, it helps to think about your energy costs on an annual basis.</p>

    <div class="faq__answer collapse" id="why-do-i-still-receive-a-utility-bill-with-solar">
      <p>You still receive a bill from the utility when you have solar because you remain connected to the grid. Even in months where your solar system provides all of the electricity you need, you can expect to pay standard utility connection fees.</p>

<p>Being connected to the grid is a good thing. It allows you to have power when your are producing less than you need, like on a cloudy day, during the winter or when you're running your air conditioning. It also allows you to take advantage of net metering so your solar power never goes to waste.</p>

      <p>Utility rate increases are unpredictable, and they’re only expected to get worse. When you replace utility power with solar power, you take control of your costs with a predictable, locked-in rate.</p>

      How can I prepare for rolling blackouts in my area?    </h5>
    <!-- Answer -->
    <div class="faq__answer collapse" id="how-can-i-prepare-for-rolling-blackouts-in-my-area">
      <p>Installing home solar and a battery as backup electricity supply is a smart wasy to prepare for rolling blackouts. Unpredictable outages emphasize the value of having solar for your household's energy security and peace of mind.</p>

<p>Utility companies are increasingly implementing rolling blackouts, known as a Public Safety Power Shutoff (PSPS), to reduce risks during extreme weather conditions and wildfires.The California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) authorizes companies to de-energize the electric grid as a preventative measure to protect public safety and maintain the grid's viability.</p>

<p>Blackouts now disrupt power to millions of Californians each year and, of course, extreme weather and power outages are not exclusive to the Golden State. Whether you are looking to power through a planned outage, winter storm or a hurricane, traditional fuel-powered generators are not a dependable solution for your emergency plan. A Sunrun solar system and Brightbox battery can safely and reliably power your home through an outage.</p>

    <div class="faq__answer collapse" id="what-are-energy-credits">
      <p>You receive energy credits from your utility company for power you produce and don't immediately use.* Your energy credits count towards any energy you get from the utility.</p>

<p>Most of the energy your panels produce is used right away. This energy does not appear on your utility bill because it never went to the grid. If you have a battery, the energy that it stores also does not appear on your utility bill.</p>

<p>*In Hawaii, energy that solar homeowners produce is not sent to the grid so utility customers do not receive energy credits.</p>

    <!-- Answer -->
    <div class="faq__answer collapse" id="will-i-get-credits-from-my-utility-with-sunrun">
      <p>Yes, your system will be grid tied and you'll get credits from your utility when you're a Sunrun customer whether you choose to own your system or go solar through a lease or PPA. These energy credits come from a billing system called Net Energy Metering (NEM). Net metering means that your utility will keep track of the solar power that you send into the grid when you are producing more than you’re using. In some months, you may run a credit for this extra power while in others you will need to buy grid power to meet the energy demands of your home. The only exception to this is in Hawaii where net metering isn't available.</p>

      What are tiered utility rates?    </h5>
    <!-- Answer -->
    <div class="faq__answer collapse" id="what-are-tiered-utility-rates">
      <p>Tiered utility rates are a structure in which the more electricity you use, the higher your rate gets. You are allowed a certain amount of power (kilowatt hours) in each tier. Once you've exceeded the amount in the tier, you move into the next highest tier. The lower tier rates are affordable and the higher tier rates are very expensive.</p>

<p>When we customize your home solar system, we assess your energy needs to determine the number of solar panels you’ll need for your home. You’ll still be connected to the grid in case you need to source any extra energy. The goal with a solar system design will be to keep you in the lower tiers so you are only replacing the most expensive power with solar.</p>

<p>Not all utilities are created equal, and not all utilities have tiered utility rates. Contact one of our expert solar consultants to learn more about your utility rate structure and how solar can help you avoid paying for power when it is at its most expensive.</p>

      What is time of use (TOU)?    </h5>
    <!-- Answer -->
    <div class="faq__answer collapse" id="what-is-time-of-use-tou-utilities">
      <p>Time of Use (TOU) electricity rates are set by your local utility. They vary by time of day: more expensive during periods of peak demand and less expensive during low demand periods. For instance, TOU rates would be higher during hot summer afternoons or nights when people tend to use their air conditioning more. Conversely, TOU rates would be lower during low-demand periods like the hours during your workday when you’re not home.</p>

<p>One way to minimize your costs is to adjust your electricity usage to cheaper times. But there’s an easier way. With Brightbox, your own home backup energy management system, you can avoid the most expensive rates under a TOU rate structure.</p>

<p>Brightbox is programmed to store energy from the sun when your grid power is cheapest and then kick in to power your home when it is most expensive. It's an easy way to get even more out of your home solar system and the power that it generates.</p>

    <div class="faq__answer collapse" id="what-is-the-environmental-impact-of-a-sunrun-system">
      <p>There are many different ways that you can measure the positive environmental impact of your Sunrun home solar system. Here are just a few:</p>

<p>It takes just 10 months of solar production for a Sunrun home solar system to offset the carbon emissions associated with its manufacture.</p>

<p>Over its lifetime, the average Sunrun solar home will prevent harmful carbon emissions equal to driving 498,778 miles in an average car, which is more than enough to drive to the moon and back.</p>

<p>When you look at cumulative impact of all 233,000 Sunrun homes, we have had the same impact as recycling 2.6 trillion pounds of waste, which is like recycling 128 Eiffel Towers.</p>

<p>As more people like you join the solar movement, the amount of impact we are able to have becomes all the more significant.</p>

      How does a home solar system work?    </h5>
    <!-- Answer -->
    <div class="collapse f5 lh-copy pl4" id="how-does-a-home-solar-system-work-getting-started">
      <p>A home solar system is made up of components that all work together to convert the power of sunlight into usable energy for your lights, appliances and devices.</p>

<p>1. Solar panels<br>
	Solar panels are made of photovoltaic cells that convert sunlight to direct current electricity (DC electricity). As long as the sun ray’s are making contact with your roof, your panels are converting solar radiation into DC electricity. Even when it’s cloudy, you can still expect your panels to produce 10% to 25% of their normal output. But your electricity isn’t ready just yet. You’ll need an inverter to get the kind of power you need to turn the lights on.</p>

<p>2. Inverter<br>
	The inverter takes the DC electricity produced by your solar panels and turns it into alternating current electricity (AC electricity). It’s typically installed on an exterior wall of your house, or in the garage.</p>

<p>3. Main electric service panel<br>
	Solar electricity from your inverter flows to the electrical panel, and then into to your home where it powers your lights and appliances. If your panels generate more solar energy than you use, the excess power will flow to the utility grid. Even better? You might even earn energy credits from your local utility for the power you send.</p>

<p>4. Sunrun meter<br>
	Your Sunrun meter monitors your system production and sends the information to us through a wireless signal. Since it tracks your energy production 24/7, it will automatically alert Sunrun if it detects problems or irregularities. That way, we can make sure your solar system is in the very best shape without you ever having to lift a finger.</p>

<p>5. Utility meter<br>
	When your system produces more than you need, the excess energy is sold back to your utility and credited to your monthly electric bill. When you need more energy than your solar system can produce, your home will automatically pull the energy from your utility. Your utility meter measures how much energy comes from and goes to the grid.</p>

      <p>You can turn on your solar system when we are granted permission to operate (PTO) from your utility. This typically occurs a few weeks after the system is installed.</p>

At this point, Sunrun submits the final documents to your utility company for interconnection, and the utility will come out to install a new net meter on your home. You will receive a letter or email from your utility company when it has granted you permission to operate, which means you can turn on your solar system.</p>

      <p>Each home is different, and the equipment we install can vary from house to house. In general, here’s what you can expect.</p>

<p>1) Solar Panels<br>
	Solar panels convert sunlight into direct current electricity (DC).</p>

<p>2) Inverter<br>
	Your inverter tells energy where to flow and converts it into alternating current electricity (AC), so it can be used in your home.</p>

<p>3) Sunrun Meter<br>
	Solar production is measured and monitored by your Sunrun meter so we can make sure your system is producing as much energy as possible.</p>

<p>There are also a few pieces of equipment that you already have at your home that are connected to the solar system.</p>

<p>4) Main Electrical Panel<br>
	Your electrical panel distributes AC electricity to your entire home. You probably know it by its other name, "Fuse Box."</p>

<p>5) Utility Meter<br>
	When the sun is shining, you may get all of your energy from solar, but due to things like weather, winter, and nighttime, you will still have to buy some energy the old-fashioned way. Your utility meter measures how much energy comes from and goes to the grid.</p>

      <p>Once we have finalized your system design and have all of the necessary approvals, it will be time to install the solar panels on your roof.</p>

<p>Our local installation crews are experienced and efficient. A lot of times, they can complete installations in one day. Here's what a typical installation day looks like:</p>

<p>Step 1 - Crew arrival and preparation<br>
	First things first. We introduce ourselves and map out where we’ll be working and parking our vehicles.</p>

<p>Step 2 - Review system design and equipment location<br>
	Your foreman will review the plans with you and confirm the equipment and where it will go.</p>

<p>Step 3 - System installation<br>
	The crew will install the solar panels and wiring on your roof, while the foreman installs your inverter and other electrical equipment.</p>

<p>Step 4 - Crew clean up<br>
	We clean up as construction winds down to make sure we leave your property exactly as we found it.</p>

<p>Step 5 - Final walk-through<br>
	Once installation is complete, your foreman will explain how your new home solar system works and how to power it on.</p>

		<div class="collapse f5 lh-copy pl4" id="my-solar-what-is-a-kwh">
			<p>kWh stands for kilowatt hour, and a kilowatt is 1,000 watts. A kilowatt hour is the standard unit of measure for electricity. It represents the amount of energy required to power a 1 kilowatt appliance for one hour.</p>

			<p>The more power an appliance consumes, the faster it will use up 1 kWh. For example, a power-hungry, 500-watt vacuum cleaner will use up a kWh in two hours, whereas the same amount of energy will power a 100 watt light bulb for 10 hours.</p>

		<!-- Answer -->

		<div class="collapse f5 lh-copy pl4" id="my-solar-at-night">
			<p>Solar panels need sunlight to create electricity--they’re dormant at night. However, you do still have power at night when you go solar through net metering or a home battery.</p>

			<p>Net Metering Makes the Most of Your Solar Production<br>
				Connecting your solar installation to the grid enables net metering. When your solar panels produce excess energy, it's sent to the grid. The utility company then provides credit on your account. At night, you can apply those credits toward drawing electricity from the grid so your solar power never goes to waste. Net metering exists in some form in all of the markets that Sunrun operates in except for Hawaii.</p>

			<p>Solar Battery Storage Offers Energy Independence<br>
				Since there is no Net Energy Metering available for new customers in Hawaii, we use battery storage to make use of solar power at night. Solar batteries maximize your panels’ daytime energy production and provide electricity for later use. So instead of sending your excess electricity to the grid, store it and use your own energy. You'll consume electricity from the battery first before drawing from the grid.</p>

			<p>A home battery or net metering enable your solar installation to access free or reduced-cost electricity at night. That’s how solar is a 24/7 affordable energy option. Sunrun solar panels and a Brightbox battery will have you covered both day and night.</p>

		<!-- Answer -->

		<div class="collapse f5 lh-copy pl4" id="my-solar-blackout">
			<p>During a power outage, Sunrun solar systems automatically turn off to protect utility workers that may be working on power lines. This means that the solar system will not provide power to the house during an outage. It will turn back on automatically when the utility restores power to the grid.<br>
				<br>
				The exception to this is home solar systems that have Brightbox, Sunrun’s solar battery service.<br>
				<br>
				Depending on where you live, Brightbox can be used for backup electricity in the event of a power outage or better control over your power usage.<br>

			<p>Shade on your solar panels decreases their efficiency. When we design your system we account for existing shade on your roof but changes in tree shape or height can increase shade and lead to decreased production over time.

		<div class="collapse f5 lh-copy pl4" id="my-solar-25-years">
			<p>The solar panels on your roof should continue to produce electricity well past the 25 year mark but their efficiency will decrease slightly over time at an average rate of 0.5% per year.</p>

			<p>We design our solar agreements with the lifespan of our equipment in mind and have taken this expected decline in performance into account in our production estimates.</p>

		<!-- Answer -->

		<div class="collapse f5 lh-copy pl4" id="my-solar-production">
			<p>When your panels don't produce as much energy as you need you will then purchase any additional power from the grid.&nbsp; This is not a sign that something is wrong, rather it is a very normal part of the seasonal shifts in solar energy production and your own personal energy consumption.</p>

			<p>When we’re designing your home solar system, we make sure it fits your household electricity needs, helping control your energy costs over time. We look at 12 months of past electricity usage to make sure your solar panels produce the the right amount of power for your home over the course of a full year.</p>

			<p>Keep in mind that there’s the chance you’ll have an unseasonably hot summer that requires you to run the air conditioning more than usual. If that’s the case, you may have to use some extra electricity from your local utility, resulting in a slightly higher energy bill for that month. Your solar panels would still be producing the amount of power they’re supposed to—your higher-than-average energy usage will just need an added boost from the grid to support it.</p>

			<p>Sunrun covers all system maintenance and guarantees that you will receive a certain amount of power from your system when you sign up for a lease or PPA. There are also few things you can do as a solar homeowner to make sure you are gettting the most out of your solar system.</p>

			<p>Trim back trees.<br>
				The more sun on your panels, the better. It's a good idea to keep nearby trees trimmed to allow the sunshine to reach your panels for as much of the day as possible.</p>

			<p>Spray dusty panels.<br>
				Just a few rainy days a year is enough to clean your panels. If you live in a particularly dusty area, you may want to hose them off — just do it from the ground to be safe.</p>

		<div class="collapse f5 lh-copy pl4" id="my-solar-service-monitoring">
			<p>Yes! We have an entire team dedicated to keeping an eye on your system, the Monitoring Team, and they’re watching all the time. This is how it works:</p>

			<p>1 – We Record Production (in Real-Time)<br>
				Among the various components of your solar system is the Sunrun Meter. It counts your kilowatts as they’re produced.</p>

			<p>2 – We Collect Your Production Data (Every Six Hours)<br>
				Four times a day, your Sunrun Meter sends your production data to our Denver, CO based Monitoring Team, where all production data is collected, stored and analyzed.</p>

			<p>3 – We Evaluate Your Production (Every Day)<br>
				We compare your production to the estimates included in your contract to confirm that your system is working as expected. We also check the weather and other systems in your neighborhood to make sure you’re harvesting just as much sunshine as your neighbors.</p>

			<p>4 – We Fix What Needs Fixing (If Necessary)<br>
				If your system isn’t working as expected, we will dive deeper to identify the issue and rectify the situation. If we cannot fix your system with remote troubleshooting, we may need to send a technician to take a look at your system in person.</p>

			<p>Though system issues do happen, if mySunrun is showing zero kWh of electricity production for a recent day or several days, it is much more likely that there’s a gap in data communication rather than system operation.</p>

			<p>We receive production data from systems via cellular signal. Sometimes those signals don't make it to us on a given day, so they’ll register as zero kWh of production.

		<div class="collapse f5 lh-copy pl4" id="how-do-i-read-my-inverter-display">
			<p>The inverter is converts the direct current (DC) electricity from the panels into alternating current (AC) electricity that can be used in your home.<br>
				<br>
				Your inverter will have a light on it that indicates if it’s working correctly:<br>
				<br>
				Green: The system is producing electricity and there are no errors.<br>
				Red: The system is not producing electricity (At night, the system will power down and show a red light or no light. It will automatically turn back on when there’s enough sun to produce electricity. If you see a red light when the sun is shining, there may be an issue.).<br>
				Orange: The AC disconnect or breaker switch is off.<br>
				<br>
				Error Codes<br>
				<br>
				The inverter will also have a screen which may show an error message if the equipment is not working correctly. These are some of the most common error codes:<br>
				<br>
				Fac-Bfr: Ground Fault<br>
				State 207<br>
				<br>
				To troubleshoot:<br>
				1) Locate and reset your breaker switch<br>
				<br>
				This small switch should be in your main service panel with the rest of the breaker switches to your home, usually located at the very bottom or top of the panel. It should be labeled solar, photovoltaic, PV or Sunrun.<br>
				Make sure this switch is in the on position.<br>
				<br>
				2) Reset the AC disconnect<br>
				<br>
				Generally, this small box is located right near your inverter, the bigger box.<br>
				The AC disconnect is a smaller 1’ x 1.5’ box with a large, lever switch on the right side.<br>
				To turn this switch on, flip the switch into the upward position.<br>
				<br>
				3) Reset the inverter*<br>
				<br>
				The inverter is normally on the side of your home or in your garage.<br>
				It’s the large 1.5’ x 3’ box with a circular dial switch on the bottom.<br>
				If you cannot see the switch, it may be behind a door on the bottom third of the inverter.<br>
				To turn this switch on, turn it a quarter turn clockwise until it is facing upward.<br>
				<br>
				*Some Sunrun systems have microinverters on each panel. These systems do not have a large inverter or a switch to turn.<br>
				<br>
				4) Check the inverter for continuing errors.<br>
				<br>
				Check the screen to see whether error codes return.<br>
				Check the light on the face of the inverter to see whether it turns green, yellow or red.<br>
				If the inverter error persists or a yellow or red light comes back, please make a note of any error codes and contact Customer Care.</p>

		<div class="collapse f5 lh-copy pl4" id="how-do-i-read-my-meter-display-how-do-i-troubleshoot-meter-issues">
			<p>Your Sunrun meter measures solar energy production and sends the data to Sunrun. We use that data to monitor your system and populate what you see in mySunrun.</p>

			<p>If your solar electricity production data doesn’t show up on mySunrun for over five days, there could be an issue. The display screen cycles through five pieces of information:<br>
				A screen test where the display shows all eights.<br>
				The total amount of electricity produced in kWh<br>
				The current date<br>
				The current time in 24-hour Pacific Time.<br>
				An SSI code, which is a five-digit number following the letters “SSI”</p>

			<p>SSI Codes<br>
				The SSI code can tell you whether the meter is working correctly. If there are five digits in the SSI code:<br>
				The last two digits show the signal strength. Zero is the weakest signal and 99 is the strongest.<br>
				The second and fourth digits show the meter state codes.<br>
				The first digit shows the coverage status code.</p>

			<p>If there are six digits, the first digit is a warning code. If you see an error code, you can reset your system.</p>

			<p><br>
				Resetting Your System<br>
				If you notice any error codes, reset the meter using the breaker switch labeled solar, PV, or photovoltaic.<br>
				Shut this switch off for at least five minutes. Then switch it back on.</p>

		<!-- Answer -->

		<div class="collapse f5 lh-copy pl4" id="does-sunrun-install-snow-guards">
			<p>In general, we don’t recommend installing snow guards. Snow guards may negatively impact your solar production, and they don't necessarily prevent snow from sliding off of your roof. In the event of snow accumulation, please avoid walking under your system, and avoid parking or keeping other valuables below the roof's edge.</p>

			<p>If you'd like to learn more about snow guards, Customer Care can connect you with a local partner for additional information. Most of our partners can handle installation within two to three weeks of your approval.</p>

		<!-- Answer -->

		<div class="collapse f5 lh-copy pl4" id="brightbox-installs">
			<p>Each home is different, and the equipment we install can vary from house to house. In general, here’s what you can expect.</p>

			<p>1) Solar panels<br>
				Solar panels convert sunlight into direct current electricity (DC).</p>

			<p>2) Inverter<br>
				Your inverter tells energy where to flow and converts it into alternating current electricity (AC), so it can be used in your home.</p>

			<p>3) Battery<br>
				Your battery stores extra solar energy for later use, like during a power outage.</p>

			<p>4) Sunrun meter<br>
				Solar production is measured and monitored by your Sunrun meter so we can make sure your system is producing as much energy as possible.</p>

			<p>5) Main electrical panel<br>
				Your electrical panel, or more familiarly the "fuse box," distributes AC electricity to your entire home.</p>

			<p>6) Backup panel<br>
				Your backup panel connects your battery to the breakers you chose to backup during installation.</p>

			<p>7) Utility meter<br>
				When the sun is shining, you may get all of your energy from solar. But due to things like weather, winter, and nighttime, you will still have to buy some energy the old-fashioned way. Your utility meter measures how much energy comes from and goes to the grid.</p>

		<!-- Answer -->

		<div class="collapse f5 lh-copy pl4" id="power-outages">
			<p>Sunrun’s batteries can back up four breakers. During installation, we will help you decide what to back up. Many customers choose to back up their refrigerator, lights, wifi and a garage door.</p>

			<p>If there is a power outage, your battery will take over sending power to your backed-up breakers within a few seconds and will continue to do so until power is restored or the battery runs out of energy. How long the battery lasts will depend on how much energy you use.</p>

			<p>Your system is designed to supply approximately 8 to 12 hours of backup energy, plus whatever the sun provides during the day. But that can vary based a variety of factors:</p>

			<p>Whether the outage happens during the day or at night<br>
				What season it is<br>
				What you’re backing up<br>
				How much energy you use</p>

			<p>The battery will recharge when the sun comes up, so you will be able to power through multi-day outages should they ever occur.</p>

			<p>Remember, you can always check the charge of your battery to help you plan your usage and make sure you have power through the night.</p>

			<p>If you live in Hawaii, your backup solution may be slightly different. A quad outlet installed near your inverter will allow you to plug in up to four things during an outage if we are unable to back up your breakers directly.</p>

			<p>During a power outage, Brightbox allows you to backup your kitchen (including the refridgerator), bedroom and bathroom lights, garage door opener and wifi for approximately 8 to 12 hours. When the sun rises again, your solar panels will recharge your Brightbox battery. The most important rooms and appliances in your home will be powered by your home battery until the grid is up and running again. <a class="sunrun-external-processed" href="http://education.sunrun.com/getting-started-brightbox">Learn more about how home solar batteries work.</a></p>

		<div class="collapse f5 lh-copy pl4" id="generator-and-brightbox">
			<p>It's possible, depending on the type of generator.</p>

			<p>For standby generators, the answer is no. We will not install a battery if you have one, because a standby generator is likely to damage your Sunrun equipment.</p>

			<p>For portable generators, the answer is yes. It is not connected to your house’s wiring, so you should be able to plug in to your generator without hurting your Sunrun equipment.</p>

			<p>Signing up for autopay allows you to avoid paying a monthly processing fee, and it frees you from the hassle of remembering to pay manually each month. Your monthly payment is automatically withdrawn from your bank account on the last business day before your due date. If your due date falls on a Saturday, the payment will be deducted on the Friday before.</p>

			<p>To sign up for autopay, log in to your mySunrun.com account. Once you are logged in, look for the billing section on the account page.</p>

			<p>Unfortunately, we don’t accept credit cards for monthly payments at this time.</p>

			<p>You can cancel autopay in four quick steps:<br>
				Click on the account tab<br>
				Click on the billing tab<br>
				Click on the green banner that reads “You are signed up for autopay. Click here to view your settings.”<br>
				Scroll down and click on the discontinue autopay link. Follow the instructions provided.</p>

			<p>We don’t recommend canceling autopay as you may have to pay an ACH non-compliance fee. Before canceling autopay, you may want to check your contract to find out whether you’ll have to pay the fee or not.</p>

		<!-- Answer -->

		<div class="collapse f5 lh-copy pl4" id="why-am-i-still-receiving-a-utility-bill">
			<p>Since your home is still connected to the grid, you will still receive a bill from your utility company. For months where your solar panels cover 100% or more of your home’s electricity usage, you will only receive a bill from your utility company for the taxes and fees associated with being connected to their grid. For months where your solar panels cover less than 100% of your home’s electricity usage, you will purchase the remaining electricity from your utility. Your utility will track how much power your home took from the grid and compare that to how much power your solar panels sent back to the grid, and it will charge you for the difference. This is known as net metering.</p>

		<!-- Answer -->

		<div class="collapse f5 lh-copy pl4" id="how-is-my-utility-bill-different-now-that-ive-gone-solar">
			<p>When the sun is shining, you may get all of your energy from solar, but due to things like weather, winter and nighttime, you will still have to buy some energy from the utility. As a result, you will still receive a utility bill, but it will be a little different from before.</p>

			<p>Your utility bill will now include energy that you sent back into the grid, as well as a billing credit as compensation. This credit will be debited from your total. If the credit is larger than what you owe for the energy you purchased, it will carry over to next month’s bill.</p>

			<p>Remember, this billing credit is only for the excess energy you sold back into the grid. It does not represent your full solar production. Most of the energy you produce is used right away. You will not see it on your utility bill because it never touched the grid, so your utility cannot see it.</p>

		<!-- Answer -->

		<div class="collapse f5 lh-copy pl4" id="why-dont-the-solar-stats-on-my-utility-bill-match-mysunrun">
			<p>The answer is simple but can make understanding your energy consumption a little more difficult. Your utility cannot see what your solar system is doing, and Sunrun cannot see what your utility is doing. As a result, your full energy portfolio is not as easy to see as we would like.</p>

			<p>Your energy falls into three different buckets.</p>

			<p>1 – Solar energy you use.</p>

			<p>2 – Solar energy you send to the grid.</p>

			<p>3 – Utility energy you bought from the grid.</p>

			<p>Sunrun can only see 1 and 2, but it cannot tell the difference between the two. This is your full solar production.</p>

			<p>Your utility can only see 2 and 3, but 2 only represents a small piece of your full solar production, because the majority of your solar production is used right away.</p>

			<p>As a result, your solar production at mySunrun.com and the data on your utility bill do not match. But don’t worry, they’re not supposed to!</p>

		<!-- Answer -->

		<div class="collapse f5 lh-copy pl4" id="why-is-my-utility-bill-higher-than-expected">
			<p>There are a few reasons why your utility bills might be higher than you expected.</p>

			<p>Electricity usage - most people end up using more electricity after they go solar. Keep in mind that using more electricity than your panels produce means you’ll be buying more electricity from your utility company. If your utility bills have gone up, think about any lifestyle changes that may have impacted your home’s usage: a new addition to your household, new appliances, lowering the AC, etc. You can check to see if your home is using more electricity by looking at how many kWhs you received from your utility and comparing it to how many combined kWhs you received from Sunrun (this is equivalent to how many kWhs your panels produced, as shown on your mySunrun dashboard) plus the kWhs you received from your utility company (look for your “net usage” on your utility bill).</p>

			<p>Seasonality - no matter where you live, your solar panels will produce more electricity in the summer and less in the winter because days are shorter in the winter and the sun is lower on the horizon. Because of this, you may be drawing more electricity from your utility in the winter. This is completely normal, and your solar production will increase once winter is over. We recommend you look at your electricity costs on an annual basis to account for this seasonality.</p>

			<p>Solar production - if there is an issue with your solar panels, that will cause you to get more of your electricity from your utility company. Rest assured, if there’s an issue with your solar panels, we’ll let you know.</p>

			<p>While most high utility bills are caused by the above reasons, system issues do sometimes affect your solar energy production. If your contract includes remote monitoring, we monitor your system 24/7 and alert you if we suspect an issue. If you suspect a performance issue, first read your inverter display to see if you can troubleshoot the issue. You can always call 1-855-4SUNRUN to report an issue and get help.</p>

		<!-- Answer -->

		<div class="collapse f5 lh-copy pl4" id="what-is-a-true-up-bill">
			<p>California utilities now bill solar households only once a year. Instead of monthly bills, they send you a monthly statement so you can track your energy use. You'll only get an actual bill (called a true-up statement) once a year.</p>

			<p>Even though your overall energy costs are likely to be lower after you go solar, the annual bill will be for an entire year of energy use at once. Make sure you've budgeted accordingly.</p>

			<p>If you’d prefer to pay your utility monthly, most still give you this option if you give them a call.</p>

			<p>Utilities adopted the annual true-up because they anticipate that solar energy producers will use considerably less utility energy overall. However, they recognize that you will produce much more energy some months than others, so:</p>

			<p>You receive energy credits from the utility for energy you produce and don't immediately use.<br>
				Unused energy credits roll over from month to month. Once a year, you and the utility will settle up.</p>

		How do I read my utility bill after switching to solar?
	</h5>
<!-- Answer -->
	<div class="collapse f5 lh-copy pl4" id="how-do-i-read-my-utility-bill">
		<p>
			You’ll still receive a bill from your utility each month. Now that you’ve switched to solar, your utility bill will look a little different. It will include monthly taxes and fees. It will tell you how much electricity you used from the utility, and how much electricity your solar system sent to the utility.
		</p>
		<p>
			Once a year, you’ll receive a true-up bill. It’s how you and the utility settle up — both how much you owe them for the grid power you used, and how much they owe you for your billing credits. You’ll pay a lump sum for the year.
		</p>
		<p>
			Your true-up bill usually comes soon after the anniversary of when you turned your system on.
		</p>
		<p>
			What is net metering and how does it work?<br>
			Net metering is an arrangement between solar households and utilities. When your solar panels produce more electricity than your home is using, extra energy is sent to the grid. In exchange, the utility gives you billing credit.
		</p>
		<p>
			When your home uses more electricity than your panels are producing, you’ll use electricity from the utility. Billing credits will help cover the cost of utility electricity before you begin to pay for power.

<!-- Answer -->
	<div class="collapse f5 lh-copy pl4" id="how-does-my-system-work">
		<p>
			Why doesn't my production data match the readings on my meter or inverter?<br>
			It can take up to 24 hours for the energy production data on mySunrun to reflect the readings on the meter. The lag will not affect your billing statement or the amount of power you are receiving.<br>
			<br>
			Can I add more panels?<br>
			In most cases, we cannot add panels to an existing solar system. We’re happy to review your situation and see if more panels or a second system are possible. Please email membercare@sunrun.com, and include 12 months’ of utility bills that you’ve received since you’ve had solar power.<br>
			<br>
			Do I need to clean my panels?<br>
			It’s normal for a little dust and dirt to build up on your panels. It won’t significantly impact your energy production, and a few rainy days a year are enough to clean your panels. If a lot of smoke, ash, or dust have dirtied your panels, they can be cleaned from the ground by pointing a hose up the roof. Avoid using metal objects or harsh abrasive products.<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			How do I keep pigeons from roosting under my solar system?<br>
			Solar panels sometimes provide an attractive place for pigeons to roost. In many instances, a critter guard can be installed to prevent animals from getting under the panels. If you are interested in critter guards, please contact Customer Care. We’ll provide a quote and help arrange the service for you.<br>
			<br>
			How do I read my Sunrun meter display? How can I troubleshoot my meter?<br>
			<br>
			Your Sunrun meter measures solar energy production and sends the data to Sunrun. We use that data to monitor your system and populate what you see in mySunrun.<br>
			<br>
			If your solar electricity production data doesn’t show up on mySunrun for over five days, there could be an issue. The display screen cycles through five pieces of information:<br>
			A screen test where the display shows all eights.<br>
			The total amount of electricity produced in kWh<br>
			The current date<br>
			The current time in 24-hour Pacific Time.<br>
			An SSI code, which is a five-digit number following the letters “SSI”<br>
			<br>
			SSI Codes<br>
			The SSI code can tell you whether the meter is working correctly. If there are five digits in the SSI code:<br>
			The last two digits show the signal strength. Zero is the weakest signal and 99 is the strongest.<br>
			The second and fourth digits show the meter state codes.<br>
			The first digit shows the coverage status code.<br>
			<br>
			If there are six digits, the first digit is a warning code. If you see an error code, you can reset your system.<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			Resetting Your System<br>
			If you notice any error codes, reset the meter using the breaker switch labeled solar, PV, or photovoltaic.<br>
			Shut this switch off for at least five minutes. Then switch it back on.<br>
			<br>
			How do I read my inverter display? How can I troubleshoot my inverter?<br>
			The inverter is converts the direct current (DC) electricity from the panels into alternating current (AC) electricity that can be used in your home.<br>
			<br>
			Your inverter will have a light on it that indicates if it’s working correctly:<br>
			<br>
			Green: The system is producing electricity and there are no errors.<br>
			Red: The system is not producing electricity (At night, the system will power down and show a red light or no light. It will automatically turn back on when there’s enough sun to produce electricity. If you see a red light when the sun is shining, there may be an issue.).<br>
			Orange: The AC disconnect or breaker switch is off.<br>
			<br>
			Error Codes<br>
			<br>
			The inverter will also have a screen which may show an error message if the equipment is not working correctly. These are some of the most common error codes:<br>
			<br>
			Fac-Bfr: Ground Fault<br>
			State 207<br>
			Try the troubleshooting steps below if you happen to see one of these codes:<br>
			<br>
			1) Locate and reset your breaker switch<br>
			<br>
			This small switch should be in your main service panel with the rest of the breaker switches to your home, usually located at the very bottom or top of the panel. It should be labeled solar, photovoltaic, PV or Sunrun.<br>
			Make sure this switch is in the on position.<br>
			<br>
			2) Reset the AC disconnect<br>
			<br>
			Generally this small box is located right near your inverter, the bigger box.<br>
			The AC disconnect is a smaller 1’ x 1.5’ box with a large, lever switch on the right side.<br>
			To turn this switch on, flip the switch into the upward position.<br>
			<br>
			3) Reset the inverter*<br>
			<br>
			The inverter is normally on the side of your home or in your garage.<br>
			It’s the large 1.5’ x 3’ box with a circular dial switch on the bottom.<br>
			If you cannot see the switch, it may be behind a door on the bottom third of the inverter.<br>
			To turn this switch on, turn it a quarter turn clockwise until it is facing upward.<br>
			<br>
			*Some Sunrun systems have microinverters on each panel. These systems do not have a large inverter or a switch to turn.<br>
			<br>
			4) Check the inverter for continuing errors.<br>
			Check the screen to see whether error codes return.<br>
			Check the light on the face of the inverter to see whether it turns green, yellow or red.<br>
			If the inverter error persists or a yellow or red light comes back, please make a note of any error codes and contact Customer care.<br>

          "@type": "Answer",
          "text": "A home solar system is made up of components that all work together to convert the power of sunlight into usable energy for your lights, appliances and devices.\n\n1. Solar panels\nSolar panels are made of photovoltaic cells that convert sunlight to direct current electricity (DC electricity). As long as the sun ray’s are making contact with your roof, your panels are converting solar radiation into DC electricity. Even when it’s cloudy, you can still expect your panels to produce 10% to 25% of their normal output. But your electricity isn’t ready just yet. You’ll need an inverter to get the kind of power you need to turn the lights on.\n\n2. Inverter\nThe inverter takes the DC electricity produced by your solar panels and turns it into alternating current electricity (AC electricity). It’s typically installed on an exterior wall of your house, or in the garage.\n\n3. Main electric service panel\nSolar electricity from your inverter flows to the electrical panel, and then into to your home where it powers your lights and appliances. If your panels generate more solar energy than you use, the excess power will flow to the utility grid. Even better? You might even earn energy credits from your local utility for the power you send.\n\n4. Sunrun meter\nYour Sunrun meter monitors your system production and sends the information to us through a wireless signal. Since it tracks your energy production 24/7, it will automatically alert Sunrun if it detects problems or irregularities. That way, we can make sure your solar system is in the very best shape without you ever having to lift a finger.\n\n5. Utility meter\nWhen your system produces more than you need, the excess energy is sold back to your utility and credited to your monthly electric bill. When you need more energy than your solar system can produce, your home will automatically pull the energy from your utility. Your utility meter measures how much energy comes from and goes to the grid."

          "text": "There are many reasons to go solar with battery storage in California, including a great incentive available to households that purchase home batteries. The Self-Generation Incentive Program (SGIP) incentivizes PG&amp;E, SCE, SCG or SDG&amp;E-powered households when they install a home solar battery to help defray costs for installing batteries. The incentive value will decrease as more households apply for it, so take advantage of it as soon as you can.\n\nOther California incentives include rebates from your local utility and the federal solar tax credit, a dollar-for-dollar reduction against your federal income tax. The 30% tax credit applies as long as the home solar system is installed by December 31, 2019. Starting in 2020, the value of the tax credit will step down to 26%, and then again to 22% in 2021. After 2021, the tax credit for residential solar ends. Get more information on California solar incentives. {Link to /solar-by-state/ca/california-solar-tax-credit]\n\nFor customers with solar leases, Sunrun applies for these rebates and tax credits, and automatically includes the benefits in our pricing."

So instead of purchasing a system outright, we offer additional options that require little to zero upfront costs.\n\nThe difference between a solar lease and solar PPA is simple: With a lease, you pay a fixed monthly “rent” in return for use of the system. With a PPA you pay a fixed price per kWh for power generated. We’ll help you decide which option is best for you. So now that you know what a solar lease and PPA is, you’re probably wondering why you shouldn’t just buy a home solar system outright. Here are a few reasons why:\n\nGet started for as little as $0 down.\nSkip the hassle of ownership. Sunrun will handle installation, maintenance, monitoring, and insurance for the life of the agreement.\nRain or shine, we guarantee solar system performance. If the system doesn’t produce the electricity we promised - for any reason - you’ll receive a refund for the difference. If the system overproduces, you keep the excess power.\nSell your home with ease. Sunrun has a team of service transfer experts and we guarantee a seamless agreement transfer to the new buyer.\nSunrun’s BrightSave plans pass down the benefits of rebates, tax incentives, and credits in the form of a low, locked-in bill.\nFlexible financing options let you pay as you go, or you can receive the lowest possible rate with a prepaid option that eliminates monthly billing from Sunrun.\nWant more reasons to get a solar lease or PPA?

However, you do still have power at night when you go solar through net metering or a home battery.\n\nNet Metering Makes the Most of Your Solar Production\nConnecting your solar installation to the grid enables net metering. When your solar panels produce excess energy, it's sent to the grid. The utility company then provides credit on your account. At night, you can apply those credits toward drawing electricity from the grid so your solar power never goes to waste. Net metering exists in some form in all of the markets that Sunrun operates in except for Hawaii.\n\nSolar Battery Storage Offers Energy Independence\nSince there is no Net Energy Metering available for new customers in Hawaii, we use battery storage to make use of solar power at night. Solar batteries maximize your panels’ daytime energy production and provide electricity for later use. So instead of sending your excess electricity to the grid, store it and use your own energy. You'll consume electricity from the battery first before drawing from the grid.\n\nA home battery or net metering enable your solar installation to access free or reduced-cost electricity at night. That’s how solar is a 24/7 affordable energy option. Sunrun solar panels and a Brightbox battery will have you covered both day and night."

We look at 12 months of past electricity usage to make sure your solar panels produce the the right amount of power for your home over the course of a full year.\n\nKeep in mind that there’s the chance you’ll have an unseasonably hot summer that requires you to run the air conditioning more than usual. If that’s the case, you may have to use some extra electricity from your local utility, resulting in a slightly higher energy bill for that month. Your solar panels would still be producing the amount of power they’re supposed to—your higher-than-average energy usage will just need an added boost from the grid to support it."

          "@type": "Answer",
          "text": "A home solar system is made up of components that all work together to convert the power of sunlight into usable energy for your lights, appliances and devices.\n\n1. Solar panels\nSolar panels are made of photovoltaic cells that convert sunlight to direct current electricity (DC electricity). As long as the sun ray’s are making contact with your roof, your panels are converting solar radiation into DC electricity. Even when it’s cloudy, you can still expect your panels to produce 10% to 25% of their normal output. But your electricity isn’t ready just yet. You’ll need an inverter to get the kind of power you need to turn the lights on.\n\n2. Inverter\nThe inverter takes the DC electricity produced by your solar panels and turns it into alternating current electricity (AC electricity). It’s typically installed on an exterior wall of your house, or in the garage.\n\n3. Main electric service panel\nSolar electricity from your inverter flows to the electrical panel, and then into to your home where it powers your lights and appliances. If your panels generate more solar energy than you use, the excess power will flow to the utility grid. Even better? You might even earn energy credits from your local utility for the power you send.\n\n4. Sunrun meter\nYour Sunrun meter monitors your system production and sends the information to us through a wireless signal. Since it tracks your energy production 24/7, it will automatically alert Sunrun if it detects problems or irregularities. That way, we can make sure your solar system is in the very best shape without you ever having to lift a finger.\n\n5. Utility meter\nWhen your system produces more than you need, the excess energy is sold back to your utility and credited to your monthly electric bill. When you need more energy than your solar system can produce, your home will automatically pull the energy from your utility. Your utility meter measures how much energy comes from and goes to the grid."

However, you do still have power at night when you go solar through net metering or a home battery.\n\nNet Metering Makes the Most of Your Solar Production\nConnecting your solar installation to the grid enables net metering. When your solar panels produce excess energy, it's sent to the grid. The utility company then provides credit on your account. At night, you can apply those credits toward drawing electricity from the grid so your solar power never goes to waste. Net metering exists in some form in all of the markets that Sunrun operates in except for Hawaii.\n\nSolar Battery Storage Offers Energy Independence\nSince there is no Net Energy Metering available for new customers in Hawaii, we use battery storage to make use of solar power at night. Solar batteries maximize your panels’ daytime energy production and provide electricity for later use. So instead of sending your excess electricity to the grid, store it and use your own energy. You'll consume electricity from the battery first before drawing from the grid.\n\nA home battery or net metering enable your solar installation to access free or reduced-cost electricity at night. That’s how solar is a 24/7 affordable energy option. Sunrun solar panels and a Brightbox battery will have you covered both day and night."

It's a good idea to keep nearby trees trimmed to allow the sunshine to reach your panels for as much of the day as possible.\n\nSpray dusty panels.\nJust a few rainy days a year is enough to clean your panels. If you live in a particularly dusty area, you may want to hose them off — just do it from the ground to be safe.\n\nWatch out for falling snow.\nIt's normal for snow to stick to your panels. Please resist the urge to clean them. The snow will slide off when it's ready. Try to avoid parking in the landing zone."

For months where your solar panels cover 100% or more of your home’s electricity usage, you will only receive a bill from your utility company for the taxes and fees associated with being connected to their grid. For months where your solar panels cover less than 100% of your home’s electricity usage, you will purchase the remaining electricity from your utility. Your utility will track how much power your home took from the grid and compare that to how much power your solar panels sent back to the grid, and it will charge you for the difference. This is known as net metering."

          "text": "There are a few reasons why your utility bills might be higher than you expected.\n\nElectricity usage - most people end up using more electricity after they go solar. Keep in mind that using more electricity than your panels produce means you’ll be buying more electricity from your utility company. If your utility bills have gone up, think about any lifestyle changes that may have impacted your home’s usage: a new addition to your household, new appliances, lowering the AC, etc. You can check to see if your home is using more electricity by looking at how many kWhs you received from your utility and comparing it to how many combined kWhs you received from Sunrun (this is equivalent to how many kWhs your panels produced, as shown on your mySunrun dashboard) plus the kWhs you received from your utility company (look for your “net usage” on your utility bill).\n\nSeasonality - no matter where you live, your solar panels will produce more electricity in the summer and less in the winter because days are shorter in the winter and the sun is lower on the horizon. Because of this, you may be drawing more electricity from your utility in the winter. This is completely normal, and your solar production will increase once winter is over. We recommend you look at your electricity costs on an annual basis to account for this seasonality.\n\nSolar production - if there is an issue with your solar panels, that will cause you to get more of your electricity from your utility company. Rest assured, if there’s an issue with your solar panels, we’ll let you know.\n\nWhile most high utility bills are caused by the above reasons, system issues do sometimes affect your solar energy production. If your contract includes remote monitoring, we monitor your system 24/7 and alert you if we suspect an issue. If you suspect a performance issue, first read your inverter display to see if you can troubleshoot the issue. You can always call 1-855-4SUNRUN to report an issue and get help."

Make sure you've budgeted accordingly.\n\nIf you’d prefer to pay your utility monthly, most still give you this option if you give them a call.\n\nUtilities adopted the annual true-up because they anticipate that solar energy producers will use considerably less utility energy overall. However, they recognize that you will produce much more energy some months than others, so:\n\nYou receive energy credits from the utility for energy you produce and don't immediately use.\nUnused energy credits roll over from month to month.

          "@type": "Answer",
          "text": "You’ll still receive a bill from your utility each month. Now that you’ve switched to solar, your utility bill will look a little different. It will include monthly taxes and fees. It will tell you how much electricity you used from the utility, and how much electricity your solar system sent to the utility.\n\nWhat is net metering and how does it work?\nNet metering is an arrangement between solar households and utilities. When your solar panels produce more electricity than your home is using, extra energy is sent to the grid. In exchange, the utility gives you billing credit.\n\nWhen your home uses more electricity than your panels are producing, you’ll use electricity from the utility. Billing credits will help cover the cost of utility electricity before you begin to pay for power.\nOnce a year, you’ll receive a true-up bill. It’s how you and the utility settle up — both how much you owe them for the grid power you used, and how much they owe you for your billing credits. You’ll pay a lump sum for the year.\n\nYour true-up bill usually comes soon after the anniversary of when you turned your system on."

Your Costco Cash Card will arrive four to six weeks after completion of the installation and signing the purchase order.\n\nIf it has been over six weeks since your system was installed and you signed off on your purchase order, please contact Costco’s call center at 844-765-0251."

        "acceptedAnswer": {
          "@type": "Answer",
          "text": "Why doesn't my production data match the readings on my meter or inverter?\nIt can take up to 24 hours for the energy production data on mySunrun to reflect the readings on the meter. The lag will not affect your billing statement or the amount of power you are receiving.\n\nCan I add more panels?\nIn most cases, we cannot add panels to an existing solar system. We’re happy to review your situation and see if more panels or a second system are possible. Please email membercare@sunrun.com, and include 12 months’ of utility bills that you’ve received since you’ve had solar power.\n\nDo I need to clean my panels?\nIt’s normal for a little dust and dirt to build up on your panels. It won’t significantly impact your energy production, and a few rainy days a year are enough to clean your panels. If a lot of smoke, ash, or dust have dirtied your panels, they can be cleaned from the ground by pointing a hose up the roof. Avoid using metal objects or harsh abrasive products.\n\nHow do I keep pigeons from roosting under my solar system?\nSolar panels sometimes provide an attractive place for pigeons to roost. In many instances, a critter guard can be installed to prevent animals from getting under the panels. If you are interested in critter guards, please contact Customer Care. We’ll provide a quote and help arrange the service for you.\n\nHow do I read my Sunrun meter display? How can I troubleshoot my meter?\n\nYour Sunrun meter measures solar energy production and sends the data to Sunrun. We use that data to monitor your system and populate what you see in mySunrun.\n\nIf your solar electricity production data doesn’t show up on mySunrun for over five days, there could be an issue. The display screen cycles through five pieces of information:\nA screen test where the display shows all eights.\nThe total amount of electricity produced in kWh\nThe current date\nThe current time in 24-hour Pacific Time.\nAn SSI code, which is a five-digit number following the letters “SSI”\n\nSSI Codes\nThe SSI code can tell you whether the meter is working correctly. If there are five digits in the SSI code:\nThe last two digits show the signal strength. Zero is the weakest signal and 99 is the strongest.\nThe second and fourth digits show the meter state codes.\nThe first digit shows the coverage status code.\n\nIf there are six digits, the first digit is a warning code. If you see an error code, you can reset your system.\n\nResetting Your System\nIf you notice any error codes, reset the meter using the breaker switch labeled solar, PV, or photovoltaic.\nShut this switch off for at least five minutes. Then switch it back on.\n\nHow do I read my inverter display? How can I troubleshoot my inverter?\nThe inverter is converts the direct current (DC) electricity from the panels into alternating current (AC) electricity that can be used in your home.\n\nYour inverter will have a light on it that indicates if it’s working correctly:\n\nGreen: The system is producing electricity and there are no errors.\nRed: The system is not producing electricity (At night, the system will power down and show a red light or no light. It will automatically turn back on when there’s enough sun to produce electricity. If you see a red light when the sun is shining, there may be an issue.).\nOrange: The AC disconnect or breaker switch is off.\n\nError Codes\n\nThe inverter will also have a screen which may show an error message if the equipment is not working correctly. These are some of the most common error codes:\n\nFac-Bfr: Ground Fault\nState 207\nTry the troubleshooting steps below if you happen to see one of these codes:\n\n1) Locate and reset your breaker switch\n\nThis small switch should be in your main service panel with the rest of the breaker switches to your home, usually located at the very bottom or top of the panel. It should be labeled solar, photovoltaic, PV or Sunrun.\nMake sure this switch is in the on position.\n\n2) Reset the AC disconnect\n\nGenerally this small box is located right near your inverter, the bigger box.\nThe AC disconnect is a smaller 1’ x 1.5’ box with a large, lever switch on the right side.\nTo turn this switch on, flip the switch into the upward position.\n\n3) Reset the inverter*\n\nThe inverter is normally on the side of your home or in your garage.\nIt’s the large 1.5’ x 3’ box with a circular dial switch on the bottom.\nIf you cannot see the switch, it may be behind a door on the bottom third of the inverter.\nTo turn this switch on, turn it a quarter turn clockwise until it is facing upward.\n\n*Some Sunrun systems have microinverters on each panel. These systems do not have a large inverter or a switch to turn.\n\n4) Check the inverter for continuing errors.\nCheck the screen to see whether error codes return.\nCheck the light on the face of the inverter to see whether it turns green, yellow or red.\nIf the inverter error persists or a yellow or red light comes back, please make a note of any error codes and contact Customer care."
